# milton_hacks_2022
A Milton Academy Hackathon project by Blake Akner, Andrew Rodriguez and Yaman Habip. 
This project takes a person's myMilton login information, accesses the person's schedule, and sends them texts when they have classes based on that information. Additonally it automatically checks the person in each morning. This project was designed in 10 hours to help fix some of the struggles of the new schedule.
